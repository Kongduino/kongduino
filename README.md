### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on too many things. But. Since Covid19 mostly on User Experience at RAK Wireless. They make, I break.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Burmese (the main language of Myanmar), LoRa, SAMD CPUs and more.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything LoRa. Especially if it involves RAK products or ESP32.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about human languages (of which I speak 7), LoRa, ESP32, or anything IoT related. I might not know the answer, but I'll help look for it!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: here and on Twitter: Kongduino. My blog https://kongduino.wordpress.com/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my career as a translator in South Korea. Went on to manage 2 companies. Dropped everything and went into the wine business, knowing zilch about it. Ended up in HK because of it. Until early 2020 was dealing wines & spirits, mostly to duty-free operators, and high net-worth individuals. Now I code from my new flat, 150 meters above the ground.
